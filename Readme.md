In GraphQL:

    Queries: Queries are how we perform GET requests and ask for data from a GraphQL API.

    Mutations: Mutations are how we perform POST, PUT, and DELETE requests to create or manipulate data through a GraphQL API.

Two main components in GraphQL know as the schemas: 

    TypeDefs: involves literally defining every piece of data that the client can expect to work with.

    Resolvers: are the functions we connect to each query or mutation to perform CRUD.
